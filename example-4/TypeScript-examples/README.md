## About Us

SitePen has a 10-year history in open source. Our first release was the Dojo Toolkit, and we continue to foster the 
open-source community through the Dojo Foundation, which oversees such projects as grunt and lodash. We are a 
contributing member to, and creator of, Intern, Mayhem, dgrid, dstore, among others. We consult as expert advisors to 
international companies and startups, and train their developers.

SitePen has [workshops on TypeScript](https://www.sitepen.com/workshops/private.html?workshop=12) and offers [support 
plans](https://www.sitepen.com/support/index.html) to help transfer our expert knowledge to you.
